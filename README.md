# BL BusTracker

## About

The "BL BusTracker" system is developed under the "Future City Innovation Challenge" initiative, which was launched jointly by UNDP and Banja Luka City. The "Future City Innovation Challenge" is an open and competitive call for proposals from civil society organisations, private sector, universities, media, public institutions that offer innovative and technology-based, yet customised solutions that would make Banja Luka smarter, greener, more resilient, inclusive and sustainable. This "Future City Innovation Challenge" aims to bring such ideas to life, catalyse action, and test innovative solutions that contribute to making Banja Luka a city of the future.

The "BL BusTracker" system is developed jointly by the research and development team from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Banja Luka.

This project contains the source code of the BL BusTracker Mobile Application, which is a user friendly and reliable mobile application for Android devices.

Now you should be able to plug your phone in (or fire up an emulator) and run the application.
